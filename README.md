# FPIs in India

2025 saw major selling by the FPIs[^1] in Indian capital markets. They (net) sold
to the tune of 1.6 lac crores. The selling which started in Jan
continued unabated, peaking in September ignoring the GST break, but not falling much. Despite the aggressive selling the markets
remained steady. DIIs and others stepped up the buying with faith in the
indian growth story. This got me looking into the FPI
data.

NSDL has a rich dataset on the daily FPI transactions (going back
to 2018s) but unfortunately released with an enormous delay (the latest is from
March 2025). Still an interesting cache for exploration. I extracted, cleaned,
and built an app in Python Shiny around this data for exploration. Students and others interested in
this data can use this tool to explore. The app is here.

Please note that specific FPIs cannot be identified as their IDs are masked and they change every month. So, if you are interested to see longitudinal patterns or hope to link the FPIs to their country of origin with FPI registration data you will be disappointed.

    FPIs (Foreign Portfolio Investors) are large foreign institutional investors
    like sovereign funds, etc. and large qualified foreign investors who
    invest in the Indian capital markets. As of September 2025,
    there were 12990 registered FPIs, of which 30% were from the US.
